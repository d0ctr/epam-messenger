# How to start
## Basic settings
### If you are using IntelliJ IDEA
- Specify JDK

- Specify out folder.

    For example, File -> Project Structure -> Modules. Here create folder out/production and out/test, make them Excluded. 
    In paths for modules manually specify ouput paths like path_to_project/out/production or test.
## Launch Server
Choose server/Server.class as main class and build an application.
## Launch Client
Choose client/Client.class as main class and build an application.

### Elimination of problems(Main class)
   If you do not manage to choose Server.class/Client.class, then check whether the src folders are active.
   
   If the src folder not of blue color, then right-click src-> Mark Directory as-> Sources Root. Do it with all folders of src.
